Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have reached a new agreement, meaning Holland's Spider-Man will remain part of the MCU. The two studios will work together on Spider-Man: Homecoming 3, due out in 2021, and the wall-crawler will also appear in another unconfirmed MCU movie.<p> <img src='https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spider-Man-with-Venom-and-Kevin-Feige.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=798&h=407'> <br> <p>NM<ZXCJASJA</p>";
